            <img src="images/IMG_2636.jpg" alt="what is this pictue"width="500">

    <p>Hello My name is Lilly Reid and I am a first year Graphic Design student at Algonquin Collage. I graduated high school in 2025. I enjoy skiing, crocheting, singing, Painting, cooking, and spending time training my dog Tucker. The person who indies me the most is my mom, Sara Reid. She taught me all through elementary school and pushed me to try the graphic design course.</p>

    <p>My dream for the future is to get a job working from home/online for a country that has a beautiful view to paint landscapes of like Sweden. I want to live where there are big mountains that I can ski down and learn how to snowboard, but not too hot where I'm getting a tan.</p>
